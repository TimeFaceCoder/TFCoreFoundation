/**
 *  An optional context to pass along with an ASTraitCollection.
 *  This can be used to pass any internal state to all subnodes via the ASTraitCollection that is not
 *  included in UITraitCollection. This could range from more fine-tuned size classes to a class of
 *  constants that is based upon the new trait collection.
 *
 *  Be aware that internally this context is held by a C struct which cannot retain the pointer. 
 *  ASTraitCollection is generally a very short-lived class, existing only to provide a non-struct API
 *  to trait collections. When an ASTraitCollection is returned via one of ASViewController's 2 
 *  custom trait collection creation blocks, traitColectionContext is assigned to the VC's traitColectionContext.
 *  This makes sure that the VC is the owner of the context and ASEnvironmentTraitCollections will not
 *  have a reference to a dangling pointer.
